📖 User Manual: MSTR Put Seller’s Dashboard1. The Core IndicatorsThe dashboard tracks two primary data points to determine the "safety" of your trade:MSTR Max Pain (Green Line): The price where the most MicroStrategy options expire worthless. This acts as a "magnet" or "floor" for the stock.BTC Max Pain (Blue Dashed Line): The same "magnet" effect for Bitcoin. Since MSTR is a proxy for BTC, if the Bitcoin magnet is rising, it provides underlying support for MSTR.2. Understanding the "Safety Score"The Score (1-10) is a real-time risk assessment of your Target Strike (the price where you want to sell your Put).ScoreRatingAction8 - 10🟢 SafeIdeal conditions. Your strike is well below the institutional magnets.5 - 7🟡 CautionModerate risk. The price or magnets are drifting closer to your strike.1 - 4🔴 DangerHigh risk. The market "magnet" is pulling the price below your strike.3. Market Phases (Confidence Levels)The "Confidence" of the Max Pain data changes depending on the day of the week. Hover over the Phase Tag in the dashboard to see these details:Provisional (Mon/Tue): Data is still being built as new trades are opened. Use this for early planning only.Sweet Spot (Wednesday): The most important day. Most institutional bets are locked in. If the safety score is high on Wednesday, the "floor" is likely solid for Friday.Reactive (Thu/Fri): The "Magnet" is at maximum strength. Expect the stock to "pin" or gravitate heavily toward the Max Pain level.4. Visual Cues & MarkersRed Diamonds (◆): These represent Monthly Expirations (the 3rd Friday of every month). These have significantly higher trading volume and exert a much stronger "gravitational pull" than regular weekly options.Dashed Line (Target Strike): This represents your personal "line in the sand." As long as the Green Max Pain line stays above this dashed line, institutions are incentivized to keep the stock price away from your risk zone.5. Ideal Conditions to Sell a PutTo maximize your "Win Rate," look for these three conditions simultaneously:Safety Score is 8 or higher.Current Phase is "Sweet Spot" (Wednesday).The Red Diamond (Monthly Expiry) is higher than your Target Strike.Next Step
